and a Spring.

The Spring needs to fit over the 5/16 Rod with space to move, and can be cut to size but about 1in or less in length will work.

Step 1:
If you have a Bolt make sure it is threaded all they way to the end.
If you are using Ready Rod, or Threaded Rod Make sure its 3 In in length and place a 5/16 Machine Nuts at one end

Step 2: 
Slid on a 608ZZ Bearing Followed by a 5/16 Machine Nut

Step 4: 
Place another 5/16 Machine Nut on. 

Step 5: 
Tight the Nut down to the one next to it until they align in the picture.
If they cant be tightened to alignment try flipping the nut over or sanding one side of it to achieve the goal
None of the nuts should come off by hand at this point.

Step 6:
Slid the Printed Gear over the Machine Nuts, the gear should be centered between the nuts.

Step 7:
Slide a 2nd 608ZZ Bearing Followed by a 5/16 Machine Nut

Step 8:
Slide a 5/15 Washer on followed by a 5/16 Lock Nut

The Spring can be trimmed to allow max Slip when in the position pictured.
By Tightening the Lock Nut at the end the Friction will increase.
